If you have a JRebel license, it makes on the fly code changes faster. Just add JRebel nature to your ${artifactId}-demo project by clicking project with right mouse button and choosing JRebel > Add JRebel Nature

To debug project and make code modifications on the fly in the server-side, right-click the ${artifactId}-demo project and choose Debug As > Debug on Server. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/${artifactId}-demo/ to see the application.

${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound}${symbol_pound} Debugging client-side

  - run "mvn vaadin:run-codeserver" on a separate console while the application is running
  - activate Super Dev Mode in the debug window of the application or by adding ?superdevmode to the URL
  - You can access Java-sources and set breakpoints inside Chrome if you enable source maps from inspector settings.
